A {wiki}[rotary encoder] looks like a potentiometer, with a shaft and
three output pins, but it rotates indefinitely in either direction.
The outputs tell you which _direction_ the encoder is rotating.

The three pins A, B, and ground (GND) are the primary outputs. When
connected to a microcontroller pins {A, B} toggle between high and low
as the shaft is rotated.

NOTE: On some encoders, two more pins provide a switch that is toggled
when the shaft is pushed. The rotary encoder shown above doesn't have
a switch, but the extra (fake) pins do add some stability on a
breadboard.

The key concept for a rotary encoder is that one pin (A or B) will
predictably change first depending on the direction the shaft is
rotated.

== Detecting Rotations

For a positive rotation (say clockwise), pin A will change before the
B pin. This happens regardless of whether {A, B} are initially high or
low. The two possible transitions that indicate a positive rotation
are shown below.

For a negative rotation (counterclockwise) the opposite is true, and
pin B changes before pin A. Again, there are two possible transitions.

== Interrupt Code

If an interrupt is enabled on pin A, then the direction of rotation
can be determined based on pin B.

The following pseudocode captures the four transitions shown in the
figures above.

[source, pseudocode]
----
if A is HIGH:
   if B is HIGH:
      rotation = NEGATIVE
   else:
      rotation = POSITIVE
else:
   if B is HIGH:
      rotation = POSITIVE
   else:
      rotation = NEGATIVE

This is implemented in the interrupt handler for PCINT1 in
{rotenc}[rotenc.c].

[source, C]
----
/**
 * Handle PCINT1 interrupt.
 */
ISR(PCINT1_vect)
{
    uint8_t pinB = bit_is_set(ROTENC_PIN, ROTENC_B);
    char rotation;

    if (bit_is_set(ROTENC_PIN, ROTENC_A)) {
        rotation = pinB ? '-' : '+';
    } else {
        rotation = pinB ? '+' : '-';
    }

    putchar(rotation);
}

A sequence of `+` and `-` characters is displayed as the rotary
encoder is rotated clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively.
