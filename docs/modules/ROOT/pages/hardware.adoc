== Materials

* [x] ATmega328p Microcontroller
* [x] Rotary Encoder
* [x] Two 10 kΩ resistors
* [x] Two 100 nF capacitors

== Schematic

Connect the rotary encoder as shown below.

The microcontroller pins you connect to should agree with
{rotenc}[rotenc.c]. I used PCINT8 (PC0) and PCINT9 (PC1) for signal A
and B, respectively. (I left pins C and D unconnected, since my rotary
enoder didn't have a switch.)

Both the microcontroller pins should be enabled as input with an
internal pull-up resistor.

.Hardware Debouncing
****
A low-pass filter is used to smooth out the jitters as the rotary
encoder is turned. This explains why pins A and B aren't connected
directly to the microcontroller.

The particular values of R and C may need to be tweaked if you plan to
spin your rotary encoder very fast. For R = 10 kΩ and C = 100 nF, the
cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter is about 160 Hz.

Here is what it looks like on my breadboard.
