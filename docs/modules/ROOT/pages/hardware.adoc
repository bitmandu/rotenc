== Materials

* [x] AVR Microcontroller (ATmega328p)
* [x] Rotary Encoder
* [x] Two 10 kΩ resistors
* [x] Two 100 nF capacitors

== Schematic

Connect the rotary encoder as shown below.

The microcontroller pins you connect to should agree with
{rotenc}[rotenc.c]. I used PCINT8 (PC0) and PCINT9 (PC1) for signal A
and B, respectively. (Pins C and D aren't connected, since my rotary
enoder didn't have a switch.)

Both microcontroller pins should be enabled as input with an internal
pull-up resistor.

.Hardware Debouncing
****

A low-pass filter is used to smooth out any jitters that might occur
as the rotary encoder is turned. This explains why pins A and B aren't
connected directly to the microcontroller.

The particular values of R and C may need to be tweaked if you plan to
spin your rotary encoder really fast. For R = 10 kΩ and C = 100 nF,
the cutoff frequency for the low-pass filter is about 160 Hz.

Here is what it looks like on my breadboard with a programmer and FTDI
Serial-USB cable attached.
