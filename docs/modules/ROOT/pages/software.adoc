== Compiling and Flashing

An AVR-GCC Makefile is provided to compile and flash the software.

[source, shell]
----
$ make
$ make flash
----

You may need to change the `PROGRAMMER = usbasp` line in
{makefile}[src/Makefile] to the {avrdude}[AVRDUDE name] for your
programmer.

== Serial Output

Connect a FTDI Serial-USB cable to see the serial output. You can use
whatever serial terminal you prefer — the Linux command
{screen}[screen] and Python’s pySerial {miniterm}[miniterm console]
are two options.

[source, shell]
----
$ miniterm.py

--- Available ports:
---  1: /dev/ttyUSB0         FT232R USB UART
--- Enter port index or full name: 1
--- Miniterm on /dev/ttyUSB0  9600,8,N,1 ---
--- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
